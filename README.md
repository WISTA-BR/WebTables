# WebTables Chrome Extension & Server

This project is a Chrome extension (with a floating icon) and a Flask server that work together to capture table data from webpages and log it into an Excel workbook with per-website tabs and daily timestamp updates. The data is GPG-encrypted during transit, and GitHub user authentication is integrated.
